Core messaging is provided by Apache ActiveMQ supporting different messaging paradigms like publish-subscribe, point-to-point, store-and-forward. Multi-protocol support (JMS 1.1, TCP, SSL, STOMP, NMS) and multi-client support (Java, C, C++) enables real-time messaging with all enterprise assets. In addition JBoss A-MQ is hosted on a lightweight OSGI-based runtime container, Apache Karaf.
