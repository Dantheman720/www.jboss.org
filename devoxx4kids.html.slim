      h3 What is Devoxx4Kids?
      p Devoxx4Kids is a worldwide effort to get kids excited about technology with the hope that many of them will become producers of technology in the future. This is achieved by organizing a variety of hands-on workshops where children build computer games, program robots, build circuits, program microcontrollers etc. and have fun. They experience and then explore technology by working with peers and instructors.
